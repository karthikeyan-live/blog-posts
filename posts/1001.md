## Introduction
In this blog, you will learn how to create a blogger website and host it in your own custom domain. If you follow this blog completely, I am sure you could create your own website in minutes and the good thing about it is you don't need to code a single line for it.
## TL;DR
- Fork the repository [karthikeyan-live/blog](https://github.com/karthikeyan-live/blog)
- Create a repository similar to [karthikeyan-live/blog-posts](https://github.com/karthikeyan-live/blog-posts) and update your data.
- Create new [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and enable Hosting

## Tech Stack
- **React Library** - for blog template
- **Markdown** - for blog post
- **GitHub** - for source control and CI
- **Firebase** - for free hosting
- **Google Analytics** - for tracking the website traffic
- **GoDaddy** - custom domain purchase

## Blog Template
I already created a started template for blog post in [this](https://github.com/karthikeyan-live/karthikeyan-live) GitHub repository. I prefer you to fork this repository(as say `blog-template`) instead of downloading it (to keep the improvements up to date). 
Before proceeding further, I will let you know what this starter code will do. This is built using `create-react-app` and has 2 pages, one(HomePage) for displaying all the available blog posts and one(BlogPage) for displaying the selected blog post. This will pick the blog posts from any another repository with a specific format, which we will configure in the GitHub secret variables later.
## Blog Posts
Create another repository in GitHub (say `blog-posts`), this is where you will add your new blog posts in the future (you may even forgot about the `blog-template` repository once you configured it). Create a file `index.json` in the root of the `blog-posts` repository, the details about the author and the blog posts will be listed here to show it in the HomePage of the website.
Paste the below code snippet in the `index.json` file.

    
    { 
	   "author":{ 
	      "firstName":"Karthikeyan",
	      "lastName":"Chandrasekar",
	      "description":"Product Manager | Web Developer and interested in volunteering activities.",
		  "imageUrl":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg",
	      "email":"karthikeyan.live@hotmail.com",
	      "twitter":"https://twitter.com/karthikeyanlive",
	      "github":"https://github.com/karthikeyan-live",
	      "skype":"karthikeyan.live@hotmail.com"
	   },
	   "posts":[ 
	      { 
	         "title":"Create personal blog website in minutes without coding",
	         "id":1001,
	         "imageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508138221679-760a23a2285b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1934&q=80",
	         "description":"Create your personal blog website(with custom domain) in minutes, without a single line of code using GitHub and Firebase Hosting",
	         "published":"18/Nov/2019",
	         "tags":[ 
	            "blog",
	            "react",
	            "firebase"
	         ]
	      },
	      { 
	         "title":"This is a dummy blog post",
	         "id":1002,
	         "imageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494253109108-2e30c049369b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80",
	         "description":"",
	         "published":"",
	         "tags":[ 
	            "dummy",
	            "react"
	         ]
	      }
	   ]
	}
    
So, let us see a little bit about the above JSON. This JSON has 2 objects, one holding the details about the author and the another to hold the blog posts. This will be the feed for the HomePage of our website.
Create a folder `posts` in the root of the repository `blog-posts`, under this folder create a md file for your post the file name will be the id of your blog post, creating a file name `1001.md` can be browse using `www.yourdomain.com/blog/1001`.

> We will connect the `blog-posts` repository with `blog-template` React application using the secret variable of GitHub later.

## Hosting
Now, we are going to host the React application in the `blog-template` repository to the Firebase. This is very simple, as I have already pre configured all the necessary steps in the React application. Create a new project(karthikeyan-live-blog) in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). In the GitHub open the settings tab of the `blog-template` repository, under the secrets section add new secret with the secret name `HOSTING_PROJECT` and your Firebase project name(karthikeyan-live-blog) as the value. Create 2 more secret variables to bind your `blog-posts` repository.

|Secret Name| Secret Value |
|--|--|
| REACT_APP_USERNAME | GitHub username (karthikeyan-live) |
| REACT_APP_REPONAME | Blog Posts repository (blog-posts) |

### Heading
You need to add one more secret variable for continuous integration. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) in your machine. Install `firebase-tools` and create a CI token and add it in the secret variable of the GitHub.

 1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
 2. Open the command prompt, run the command `npm install firebase-tools`
 3. Login to the Firebase using the command `firebase login:ci`, on successful verification a token will be generated in the command prompt.
 4. Copy this token and add it to the secret variable of the GitHub repository with the name `FIREBASE_TOKEN`

The setup is done, now go to the Actions tab of the GitHub Repository (blog-template) you could see the CI workflow failed already. Rerun the failed workflow your project will build and publish in the FireBase hosting. You can now browse your website in the below URL ([https://karthikeyan-live-blog.firebaseapp.com/](https://karthikeyan-live-blog.firebaseapp.com/))

> You may face certificate issue when browsing this website in the browser, if you created the Firebase hosting now. It will be resolved within 48 hours or less.
## Google Analytics
Create a project in the Google Analytics and get the Tracking ID  (refer [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015))
