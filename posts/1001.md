## Introduction
In this blog, you will learn how to create a blogger website and host it in your own custom domain. If you follow this blog completely, I am sure you could create your own website in minutes and the good thing about it is you don't need to code a single line for it.

## Blog Template
I already created a started template for blog post in [this](https://github.com/karthikeyan-live/karthikeyan-live) GitHub repository. I prefer you to fork this repository instead of downloading it (to keep the improvements up to date). 
Before proceeding further, I will let you know what this starter code will do. This is built using `create-react-app` and has 2 pages, one(HomePage) for displaying all the available blog posts and one(BlogPage) for displaying the selected blog post. This will pick the blog posts from any another repository with a specific format, which we will configure in the GitHub environment variables later.
## Blog Posts
Create another repository in GitHub, this is where you will add your new blog posts in the future (you may even forgot about the BlogTemplate repos).
