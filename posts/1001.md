## Blog Template
I already created a started template for blog post in [this](https://github.com/karthikeyan-live/karthikeyan-live) GitHub repository. I prefer you to fork this repository instead of downloading it (to keep the improvements up to date). 
Before proceeding further, I will let you know what this starter code will do. This is built using `create-react-app` and has 2 pages, one for displaying all the available blog posts and one for displaying the selected blog post.
